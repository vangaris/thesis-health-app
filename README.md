This is the final project of my Master's degree in the University of Piraeus (CS).

My primary goal is to create an app that will help people to save their examinations from doctors and hospitals.

Also, it was challenging for me to implement this app with state-of-the-art technologies like MongoDB, nodeJS, and react.

Some of the technologies, frameworks, and libraries:

DataBase a.noSQL mongo DB b.GUI 3T

Framework a. NodeJS b. express

3. Libraries

  React
  npm libraries
  mongoose
  middleware
  bcryptjs
  jsonwebtoken
  jsonwebtoken
  validator
